								Ever since I was young, I knew my life's calling was with animals, even despite the fact that I had no pets of my own. In high school, my two part time jobs, one as a stable-hand working with horses and the other working in a groomery, solidified that calling.  I felt profoundly at home in these positions, where I spent every day with animals. In the wake of these experiences, I was inspired to apply to SUNY Delhi where I later graduated with an A.A.S in Veterinary Science. From there, I moved to the beautiful island of Bermuda, where I was a veterinary nurse for a year and half. When I returned back to the states, I earned my Veterinary Technician License and continued growing in the veterinary field, most recently working at North Shore Animal League, where my experiences with the more severe and dangerous types of pathology, grew tremendously.  I am very excited to bring my immense passion for animals and my range of experiences to Alison Animal Hospital. Hope to meet you soon!

								From a very young age I was fascinated with animals. Whether it be learning the different breeds, watching emergency veterinary shows on animal planet, or having my head in a behavioral book, it was evident that working with animals was my calling. After achieving my secretary certification and years of studying animal behavior, I thought, "what better way to combine my skills than in the veterinary setting?" As an administrative coordinator, I may not be hands-on with the animals, but I continually strive to optimize the experience of the client and the animal-patient bond from the moment you both walk into our hospital.  As a behaviorist, my strengths lie in obedience, understanding animal psychology, leash training, and puppy behavior and modification. I look forward to meeting you and your animal and welcome any feedback you may ever have.
